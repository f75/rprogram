=== 0.1.5 / 2009-01-14

* Use Kernel.system in RProgram::Program#run, instead of Open3.popen3:
  * popen3 is not well supported on Windows.
  * win32-open3 does not allow for the execution of single programs with
    separate command-line arguments. Instead, it merely executes a command
    string in command.com. This seems to allow arbitrary command injection
    via command-line arguments.
  * RProgram::Program#run will now return either +true+ or +false+,
    depending on the exit status of the program.
* Added some missing documentation.
